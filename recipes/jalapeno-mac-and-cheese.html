    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Quick and easy jalapeno popper mac and cheese recipe- A 30 minute weeknight meal loaded with cream cheese, cheddar cheese and requires one pot.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound large shape pasta</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp flour</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 pound Pepper Jack cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>1-2 jalapenos, thinly sliced, seeds and all</li>
        <li>salt and fresh cracked black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Set oven to 350F</li>
        <li>Set aside 1/2 cup or so of the shredded cheese for topping.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta in plenty of salted water just until al dente. I usually cook pasta a good 2 or 3 minutes less than the package says. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large pan and add the flour. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, for a minute or so. Add the milk and stir or whisk until well combined. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens. Remove from the heat and add the cheese, a little at a time, while stirring, until all the cheese has been incorporated and the sauce is smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Stir the cooked pasta into the sauce, along with the sliced jalape√±os and mix well. Top with the reserved cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 30-40 minutes until browned and bubbling throughout. You can run it under the broiler for a minute or two at the end to brown it further. Serve right away with a green salad.</li>
    </ol>
