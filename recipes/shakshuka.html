    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Shakshuka is a flavorful tomato stew with garlic, onions, peppers, and poached eggs. The actual origin of shakshuka is up for debate, but it’s a popular breakfast food in North Africa and the Middle East. (Although we think this dish makes a great healthy dinner, too!).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Yellow onion</li>
        <li>Red bell pepper</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Cumin</li>
        <li>Ground coriander</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Canned crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat until shimmering, then add garlic and sauté until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add diced onion and bell pepper. Cook until slightly softened and onions begin to turn translucent.</li>
        <li>Combine the spices in a small bowl, then sprinkle over the peppers and onions and stir to coat.</li>
        <li>Stir in the canned tomatoes and lower to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Make 3 wells in the stew and crack an egg into each one. To poach the eggs, simply cover the pan and let cook for about 8 minutes or until done. To cook the eggs like we did (no runny yolk), immediately break up the yolks with a fork, then cover and cook for about 15 to 20 minutes or until done.</li>
